## üë®‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Happy Father's Day. Keep kicking ass ‚úÖ and making great kids üö∏!

To all the dad's everywhere, keep up the good work. We teach our kids they shouldn't be upset over every single mistake. We remind them that everyone makes mistakes, even the great ones. But, what separates the great ones from everyone else is they deliver. Every time. They deliver, and all of you dad's know what I am saying and we do it day in and day out. We do it because we have to, because we couldn't imagine not doing it. Because it is our duty. Shit needs to get done. And we teach our kids to pick themselves up when they fall down, to not let just one mistake get them down. Because, You do not stop. Never! Not until our last breathe.
