Remember to save often and early. Written entirely on my phone. This is version 2. Version 1 was better. Some leasons you relearn over and over.

Let me know what Mario means to you in the comments. :beers: to gamers of all types. whenI was 5, Mario was God!

The playstation 5 is blowing my mind ðŸ¤¯. 4K with 60fps is legit! The DualSense feels amazing in your hands. 3D Surround audio sounds great with any set of headphones. I should be playing right now.....
If you haven't played the Rise of the Tomb Raider demo, which is on sale currently for $5.99 and seems like a steal, you will be blown away with how great it looks in stunning 4K. And the gameplay for Demon's Souls looks abolutely amazing! I didn't know my TV was capable of looking that good until seeing these games. Or any of the games on PS5. Astro's Playroom is legit and a ton of fun.

You have to wonder what the mid-lifecycle Ninetndo Switch upgrade is going to be, and if Zelda: BOTW2 is far behind. I hope the Switch garners more 3rd party support to make some great AAA games appear on the system.

## Cheers to everyone :beers:

As much as a technology detox is a good thing, being able to write this on my phone, make a commit to the branch, create a merge request and merge it which triggers the build process that pushes it to the, ..., think of all the XHR requests that go on between each step.

Technology is ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯.
