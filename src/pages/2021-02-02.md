The Loch Ness monster [might no longer be a mystery](https://brobible.com/culture/article/mystery-loch-ness-monster-solved-scientist/). It also is not longer a mystery that [Tom Brady](https://rb.gy/oajy96) was the secret sauce behind the [Patriots reign that has started to crumble](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/tom-brady-sr-guesses-bill-belichick-is-on-a-little-bit-of-a-hot-seat-right-now-after-son-reaches-super-bowl/). After Tom Brady and The New England Patriots won 6 Super Bowls together and appeared in 10, the Patriots didn't even make the playoffs, but Tom Brady is leading the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to the Superbowl this year.

As a Pittsburgh Steelers' fan, I haven't been the biggest Patriots since Brady came in the league, because they were always trouble for everyone else. Always a force to be reckoned with. But no more. By the way, [Roethlisberger wants to play next year](https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-north/pittsburgh-steelers/ben-roethlisberger-has-informed-the-steelers-of-his-plans) and is reportedly taking a pay cut because of the Steelers cap situation. But, like other people that don't like the Patriots, I felt like I knew Brady would surely fail going to Tampa Bay. It had to have been the system that the Patriots have setup for greatness, right?! Ultimately, Tom Brady must have started to have the Patriots to leave all that, too. You don't just leave after being in a dynasty and expect to carry that greatness with you, but he is. That is superhero legendary.

So now, if Brady takes the Buccaneers to a Superbowl victory, and has 7 rings... 7 rings. Three more than Bradshaw and Montana, who are legends. And he is going to be the [oldest person to every play in a Super Bowl](https://rb.gy/ezb7ap). Then Tom Brady is the ultimate legend. A superhero of football. And my respect for him just went through the roof.

It would be fantastic to see thrash legends MetallicA play a Superbowl, which they have not at this point. But since they are not playing at this year's Superbowl, at least they are [playing live on the Late Show with Stepehn Colbert](https://loudwire.com/metallica-super-bowl-edition-late-show-with-stephen-colbert/).

I have been hearing a lot about [love languages](https://www.popsugar.com/love/how-to-love-your-partner-based-on-their-enneagram-type-48118623?utm_source=flipboard&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=feed), and it actually seems to make a lot of sense. You should check it out. If you don't want to, you could ask [Dall-e, the machine learning software that can draw anything](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/here-s-dall-e-algorithm-learned-draw-anything-you-tell-n1255834) for you on request. (Try [skinny jeans going away](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/business/levi-baggy-jeans/index.html). I can picture what that would look like.) So now that I have convinced you to check it out, you might realize your partner is loving you way more than you knew, just not how you were thinking they should and vice-versa. Love languages help a lot in clear communication, like what Punxataney Phil "said" today when he told those of us covered in snow that there is ["6 more weeks of winter"](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/groundhog-day-2021-results-punxsutawney-phil-predicts-6-more-weeks-of-winter/). My love language is showing Phil a one-fingered response with a smile.

A decent way to check if an Object is an Object or an Array has eluded me for a while. I found [this interesting solution](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/javascript-check-if-a-variable-is-an-object-and-nothing-else-not-an-array-a-set-etc-a3987ea08fd7). Basically doing this:

`Object.prototype.toString.call(userVariableToCheck)`

I would be curious to know what you think about it. Leave me a comment with your thoughts in solving this problem with modern JavaScript.

In tech news, [Bezos is leaving Amazon sometime this year](https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-ceo-jeff-bezos-step-year-replaced-aws-chief-andy-jassy/). [Another Quest is in development](http://virtualrealitytimes.com/2021/01/29/facebook-confirms-another-new-oculus-quest-headset-currently-in-development/) (no surprise here). We could see a semi-regular update similar to how we upgrade our phones as the current software is supposed to be forward compatible with the next headset. It will be interesting to see the results as the platform matures. With the [Nintendo Switch sales](https://rb.gy/m20z3s) being the news that no one seems to be talking about, many of us are [still wanting to find out about the alleged Switch Pro](https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-pro-super-rumor/) that could be announced in the future.

And [RIP Screech](https://people.com/tv/dustin-diamond-dies-at-44-after-cancer-battle/)! It was amazing to watch you over the years.
